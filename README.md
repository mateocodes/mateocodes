# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mateo

## I'm a developer, tech enthusiast, comedy fan and avid podcast listener

- 📚 Currently learning Android upgrading my skills as a JS and React developer and lurking on Shopify!
- ⚙️️ Currently working full-time as a Full Stack Software developer, and lately I have been focused on JavaScript, jQuery, Java and MariaDB and all sorts of other stuff. You can check my work profile right here: https://github.com/mkomljenovic/. I also can do all sorts of different stuff like React, Node, Gatsby, Jest, RTL, Mocha, Chai, GraphQL and friends...
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Learn even more about web development, web3 and crypto/blockchain ₿, write blogs ✍️, and start with YouTube 📹
- 👻 Fun fact: I just got myself a rabbit and it ain't a starter pack pet as everyone says.🐇
